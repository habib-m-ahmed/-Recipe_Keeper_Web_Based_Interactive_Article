<b>Tool Selection</b>
<p></p>

Recipe Keeper is an all-in-one recipe organizer, shopping list, and meal planner available across devices. The app allows users to store all their recipes in one place, so that they can better plan their meals and grocery needs. Our redesign aimed to optimize the current design for the target users, adults aged 20-40 who have busy schedules and are looking to minimize their time spent on tedious cooking-related tasks.

<b>Improved and Implemented Feature Overview</b>
<p></p>

Through our knowledge of design principles, we implemented new features and states to improve the overall experience of the user. Some of the core experiences that we improved include Adding recipes, interacting with them, comparing them, representing all the data in useful ways, and weekly planning. The implementation of these features helps to better satisfy users and make the app more flexible and efficient to use. In particular, we organized the redesign into the following states:
<ul>
  <li>Sous-Chef (Voice Assistant)</li>
  <li>Planner</li>
  <li>Search</li>
  <li>Comparison</li>
  <li>Meal Recommender</li>
  <li>Bulk Add</li>
  <li>Ingredient Scanner</li>
</ul>
<p></p>
  
When considering the underlying information such as quantitative, qualitative, and text data, our redesign was focused on presenting the data in an easy-to-understand manner. For example, within the comparison feature, when a user is comparing the nutritional information of two different recipes, as the information is quantitative, the representation is able to highlight the “better” recipe based on the statistic.
<p></p>
  
Our redesign also takes into account the cognitive abilities and limitations of users while using the app. For instance, while cooking, users may not be able to read instructions or interact with the app using their hands. To address this, we have included “Sous Chef”, a voice and audio feature that allows users to access recipes using voice commands.

Our heuristic evaluation and overview of design principles showed significant improvements in the match with the real world by understanding the user's actual needs and context in which they use the app. While there is still room for certain improvements as discussed, the redesign provides a strong foundation for an app that truly allows users to “Cook more. Eat Healthier. Shop Smarter”.
