      As highlighted in our initial proposal, the app’s tagline is to “Cook more. Eat Healthier. Shop Smarter.” Our design approach focuses on considering key parts of the user experience and implementing / improving features that help it better achieve that promise.

    <p>
      Our redesigned Recipe Keeper app has been created to store and process the same information as the original app, but in a manner that ensures an ideal user experience through more suitable cognitive effects. To achieve this, our design process focused heavily on how to represent the information and build interactions that aligned with the users' needs. Our design approach was based on the representation design framework that considered user tasks, underlying information, cognitive abilities, and context of use.
    </p>

    <p>
      To address user tasks such as comparison, adding to planner, and viewing recipes, our redesign focuses on intuitive interactions that are easy to use and help users to achieve their goals efficiently. For example, our recipe comparison feature uses a side-by-side layout that enables users to compare two recipes quickly. Additionally, our meal planner feature allows users to add recipes into their calendar, making it easier to plan and organize meals.
    </p>

    <p>
      When considering the underlying information such as quantitative, qualitative, and text data, our redesign was focused on presenting the data in an easy-to-understand manner. For example, within the comparison feature, when a user is comparing the nutritional information of two different recipes, as the information is quantitative, the representation is able to highlight the “better” recipe based on the statistic. 
    </p>

    <p>
      Our redesign also takes into account the cognitive abilities and limitations of users while using the app. For instance, while cooking, users may not be able to read instructions or interact with the app using their hands. To address this, we have included “Sous Chef”, a voice and audio feature that allows users to access recipes using voice commands.
    </p>

    <p>
      Finally, our redesign considers the context of use, which includes being organized with recipes, wanting to cook more, and being informed. Accordingly, we have included a search feature that makes it easy for users to find recipes based on their dietary requirements or preferences. This was also the inspiration for a meal recommender feature, where showing the user the picture of a delicious recipe that they could make would encourage them to not only cook but also use other aspects of the app.

  <h3>Home:</h3>
  
    The home screen features all recipes. Users can click into the “Main Dish” quadrant to access the recipe comparer feature. 
  
  <h3>Search:</h3>

    Users can click on “Advanced Search” to access this functionality. They are then able to filter recipes based on words, preparation, and/or nutritional information using the accordion style menu. 
 
  <h3>Recipe Comparer:</h3>

    Users can drag and drop two recipes to compare their nutritional makeup in a side-by-side fashion.

  <h3>Meal Planner:</h3>

    Users can then click the “Meal Planner” button on the left navigation tab to access this feature. They can press the “+ Add Meal”' button to manually add meals to the weekly planner. This involves selecting the date, meal type, and recipe. Alternatively, they can press and hold the spacebar to auto-populate the entire week with meals based on the user’s preference. Note, for the purposes of the Figma, this interaction entails clicking a space bar (vs. holding it down).

  <h3>Recommender:</h3>

    When clicking back into Home, the user is served a recommendation based on the time of day and their eating preferences. They can choose to view the recipe or hit cancel.

  <h3>Bulk Add:</h3>

    Users can select the “+ New Recipe” option from the left navigation bar, and choose “Import recipe from website” to access this feature. They are then able to bulk add multiple recipes (at one time) by clicking on the “+” button to input more links.

  <h3>Recipe Scanner:</h3>

    To access the recipe scanner, the user must select the “Shopping List” option on the left navigation bar. They are then able to upload a photo. If the photo fails to upload, they are encouraged to retry the operation. Once the image has been successfully uploaded, they can click into it in order to identify the different ingredients. They are then able to select/tick these ingredients and hit “add” to populate their shopping list with the chosen items.

  <h3>Sous Chef Mode:</h3>

    Users can press the “Sous Chef Mode” option on the left navigation bar to access the voice assistant. They are then able to walk through a sample recipe from start to finish. Note, for the purposes of the Figma, the voice commands are not operational and are purely illustrative.
